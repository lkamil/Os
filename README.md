# 🏔 Os

Os is an generative art project that generates an endless video of different landscapes based on Audio Input.
Currently it is mainly developed as a part of [Resonance](https://github.com/sync-union/Resonance) (A project that combines two eternal streams of ever changing, resonating music and land).
